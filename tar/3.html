            A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye which leads to a decrease in vision. Cataracts often develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may include faded colors, blurry or double vision, halos around light, trouble with bright lights, and trouble seeing at night. This may result in trouble driving, reading, or recognizing faces.Poor vision caused by cataracts may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression.
             Cataracts cause half of all cases of blindness and 33% of visual impairment worldwide.<br>

           Cataracts are most commonly due to aging but may also occur due to trauma or radiation exposure, be present from birth, or occur following eye surgery for other problems.
            Risk factors include diabetes, smoking tobacco, prolonged exposure to sunlight, and alcohol.
             The underlying mechanism involves accumulation of clumps of protein or yellow-brown pigment in the lens that reduces transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye.
             Diagnosis is by an eye examination.<br>

           Prevention includes wearing sunglasses, a wide brimmed hat, eating leafy vegetables and fruits, and avoiding smoking.
            Early on the symptoms may be improved with glasses.If this does not help, surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens is the only effective treatment.
             Surgery is needed only if the cataracts are causing problems and generally results in an improved quality of life.<br>
              Cataract surgery is not readily available in many countries, which is especially true for women, those living in rural areas, and those who do not know how to read.

           About 20 million people are blind due to cataracts. It is the cause of approximately 5% of blindness in the United States and nearly 60% of blindness in parts of Africa and South America. Blindness from cataracts occurs in about 10 to 40 per 100,000 children in the developing world, and 1 to 4 per 100,000 children in the developed world.
            Cataracts become more common with age. In the United States, cataracts occur in 68% of those over the age of 80 years. Additionally they are more common in women and White people.<br>

        <p>
            Age is the most common cause. Lens proteins denature and degrade over time, and this process is accelerated by diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. 
            <br>Environmental factors, including toxins and radiation, including ultraviolet light, have cumulative effects, which are worsened by the loss of protective and restorative mechanisms  
            due to alterations in gene expression and chemical processes within the eye
