            Glaucoma is a group of diseases affecting the optic nerve that results in vision loss and is frequently characterized by raised
             intraocular pressure (IOP). There are many glaucoma surgeries, and variations or combinations of those surgeries, that facilitate the escape of excess 
             aqueous humor from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, and a few that lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous.<br>

            Goniotomy and trabeculotomy are similar simple and directed techniques of microsurgical dissection with mechanical disruption of the trabecular meshwork.
            Goniotomy procedures include surgical goniotomy and laser goniotomy. A surgical goniotomy involves cutting the fibers of the trabecular meshwork to allow aqueous fluid to flow more freely<br>
             from the eye. Laser goniotomy is also known as goniophotoablation and laser trabecular ablation . In many patients suffering from congenital glaucoma, the cornea is not clear enough to visualize 
             the anterior chamber angle. Although an endoscopic goniotomy, which employs an endoscope to view the anterior chamber angle, may be performed, a trabeculotomy which accesses the angle from the exterior surface of the eye, 
             thereby eliminating the need for a clear cornea, is usually preferred in these instances.<br>
            A specially designed probe is used to tear through the trabecular meshwork to open it and allow fluid flow 
            Canaloplasty is a nonpenetrating procedure utilizing microcatheter technology. To perform a canaloplasty, <br>
            an incision is made into the eye to gain access to Schlemm's canal in a similar fashion to a viscocanalostomy. 
            A microcatheter will circumnavigate the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic.
             The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened. By opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye can then be relieved. Canaloplasty has two main advantages of over more traditional glaucoma surgeries.<br>
              The first of these advantages is an improved safety profile over trabeculectomy. As canaloplasty does not require the creation of a bleb, significant long-term risks such as infection and hypotony (extremely low eye pressure) are avoided. The second main advantage is that when combined with cataract surgery, the IOP is reduced even further than when done alone.
               Long term (three year) results have been published both in the US and Europe
            demonstrating a significant and sustained reduction in both eye pressure and the number of glaucoma medications required for glaucoma control.
