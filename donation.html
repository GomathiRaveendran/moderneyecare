        <h3 style="text-align:left;">What is Eye Donation?</h3>
Eye donation is an act of donating one’s eyes after his/her death. Only corneal blinds can be benefitted through this process not other Blinds. It is an act of charity, purely for the benefit of the society and is totally voluntary. It is done after death. So eye-donation should be encouraged in a large scale, as one of the best means of social service. To enable another person obtain vision is one of the best forms of charity. Even after death the donor lives in the eyes of recipient. Eyes from a dead person can enable two blind people to acquire vision.

        <h3 style="text-align:left;">What is the use of eyes received?</h3>
The eyes, which are received through such magnanimous gestures, are of great benefit to the society. The front, clear and transparent tissue of the eye called as cornea can be used to restore vision to corneal blind person. The other portions of the eye are also used for research and training purposes to develop cures for some of the common eye diseases.

        <h3 style="text-align:left;">How can one donate eyes?</h3>
The eyes of a dead person can be used only if they are taken out within 6 hrs of death. When a person who has given consent for the donation of one's eyes dies, the eye should be kept wet by sprinkling water on them. Otherwise pieces of cotton wool soaked in water should be placed on both the eyes so that the cornea does not become dry till the eye-surgeon arrives. After the removal of the eyes the eyelids will be stitched together and there will be no visible sign of the eyes having been removed. The entire process is completed within 10-15 mins, therefore if one pledged to donate his eyes after death, it is the duty of his relatives to inform to the nearest eye bank after his death.

        <h3 style="text-align:left;">What is an Eye Bank?</h3>
An Eye Bank is a charitable organization and is not for profit .They are purely functioning for the benefit of the society. The eye banks facilitate removal of eyes, processing of eyes and evaluation of the eyes and distribute them to the needy. The first Eye Bank was set up in United states in 1945 at Newyark City. Around 500 + – Eye banks in India.

        <h3 style="text-align:left;">After the removal of eyes, would there be any complications or disfigurement?</h3>
There are two methods adopted for removal of eyes. Some eye banks would remove the whole eyeball. In such a case there may be temporary bleeding. The team is well trained to take care of such eventualities. There would be no disfigurement. The eye bank team, after the removal of eyes would properly close the eyes so that there is no disfigurement. The second method is the removal of only the clear transparent tissue. Here also a plastic shield is placed in place of the tissue and no difference can be noticed.

        <h3 style="text-align:left;">Is eye donation against religious principles or traditions?</h3>
All religions endorse eye donation. There are numerous examples in our traditions and scriptures, which endorse eye and organ donation. A part of the body would be consumed by flames and reduced to ashes or which is buried and allowed to decay and disintegrate & cannot be put to a better use than restoring vision to the needy!!!

        <h3 style="text-align:left;">Who can donate eyes? Is there any age limit?</h3>
Any person of any age can donate eyes. Even if the deceased has medical history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, tuberculosis etc., and even spectacle wearers and people who have undergone cataract operation can donate eyes.
